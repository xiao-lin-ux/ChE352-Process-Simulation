The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures
aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from
a gas turbine located in Turkey's north western region for
the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, namely CO and
NOx (NO + NO2). The data comes from the same power plant
as the dataset used for predicting hourly net energy yield.
By contrast, this data is collected in another data range
(01.01.2011 - 31.12.2015), includes gas turbine parameters
(such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge
pressure) in addition to the ambient variables. Note that
the dates are not given in the instances but the data are
sorted in chronological order. See the attribute information
and relevant paper for details. Kindly follow the protocol
mentioned in the paper (using the first three years' data
for training/ cross-validation and the last two for testing)
for reproducibility and comparability of works. The dataset
can be well used for predicting turbine energy yield (TEY)
using ambient variables as features.
